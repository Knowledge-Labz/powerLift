powerLift is a Python interface built to juice PowerShell while keeping a cool head.
It aims at using PowerShell as its simplest, easiest form while delegating the heavier logical lifting to Python through YAML and Jinja2.

After years of frustrating Windows administration and PowerShell misunderstandings and updates, experience led me to using PowerShell as a less-flexible more-asynchronous bash.
No more debugging overly-explicit code, just fill in the blanks, have a covfefe and review the (hopefully few or none) errors!
